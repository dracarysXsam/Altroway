# 🚀 Phase 1 Completion Guide - Altroway

## 🎯 **Current Status: Phase 1 - Core Enhancement (75% Complete)**

### ✅ **COMPLETED Features:**
- ✅ Authentication system with Supabase
- ✅ User profile management (CRUD operations)
- ✅ Role-based access control (job_seeker, employer, legal_advisor)
- ✅ Employer dashboard with job posting functionality
- ✅ Basic document management system
- ✅ Form validation and error handling

### 🚧 **IN PROGRESS Issues to Fix:**
1. **Database Schema Issues** - Profile update constraints
2. **Form Submission Errors** - `formData.get is not a function`
3. **Storage Bucket Missing** - File upload errors
4. **Missing Dashboards** - Job seeker and legal advisor views

---

## 🔧 **STEP-BY-STEP FIXES**

### **Step 1: Apply Database Migration**

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
3. **Copy and paste the entire content from `supabase/migrations/06_fix_all_issues.sql`**
4. **Run the migration**

This will:
- ✅ Fix all database schema issues
- ✅ Create proper table relationships
- ✅ Set up Row Level Security (RLS)
- ✅ Add sample data for testing

### **Step 2: Set Up Supabase Storage**

1. **Go to Storage in Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Create these buckets:**

#### **Bucket 1: `documents`**
```sql
-- Run this in SQL Editor
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) VALUES ('documents', 'documents', false);
```

#### **Bucket 2: `avatars`**
```sql
-- Run this in SQL Editor
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) VALUES ('avatars', 'avatars', true);
```

3. **Set up RLS policies for storage:**

```sql
-- Documents bucket policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own documents" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'documents' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own documents" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'documents' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

-- Avatars bucket policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatars" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view avatars" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');
```

### **Step 3: Test the Application**

1. **Restart your development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. **Test the following flows:**
   - ✅ User registration and login
   - ✅ Profile creation and updates
   - ✅ Job posting (for employers)
   - ✅ File uploads
